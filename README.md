# BigData Projects
1. Realtime BigData Pipeline Analytics:In this project, we are worked on a huge real time dataset from City of Chicago Dataset like Traffic Congestion estimates, Red Light Camera Violations, Speed Violations, Traffic Crashes and Towed Vehicles dataset containing multiple features which are important to draw a conclusion about these violations and their effects or damages may be financial or health related. We have visualized various parameters of this dataset to get a better understanding of this data and build a  Machine Learning model to build the outcome using Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Also we have built a pipeline by using tools such as Kafka/ AWS Kinesis and AWS DynamoDB by extracting real time data and loading it into this pipeline.
